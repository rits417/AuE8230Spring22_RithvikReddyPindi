There are 3 python files in the scrips folder inside the assignment2 package. I am using respective launch files to execute those scripts.

Circle.py : turtlesim is moving in circle 

Square_openloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 2x2 units with 0.2 linear
velocity and 0.2 rad/s angular velocity.

square_closedloop.py: Make the Turtle move in a square of 3x3 with velocity control.
Predefine the coordinate points of the square in the program. Make the turtle move from
(5,5) ->(8,5) -> (8,8) -> (5,8) -> (5,5).
